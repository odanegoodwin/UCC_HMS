Purpose of code:

In today’s fast-paced healthcare environment, managing patient care efficiently is more important than ever. Hospitals are complex institutions that handle a wide range of responsibilities, including maintaining accurate patient records, coordinating doctor schedules, managing appointments, and handling billing procedures. Traditionally, these tasks are managed through a combination of manual logs, spreadsheets, and isolated digital tools — a process that is often inefficient, error-prone, and difficult to scale.
To address this challenge, healthcare institutions turn to Hospital Management Systems (HMS) — software platforms designed to streamline operations, improve data accuracy, and reduce administrative workload. By automating processes such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, and billing, HMSs enable hospitals to offer better care and reduce wait times.
